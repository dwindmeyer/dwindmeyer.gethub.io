<h2>About us!</h2>
	<p>In September 2023, a new corporation called Windmeyers Vision was founded. It all began with the creator's passion for eyewear. Dana Windmeyer is the inventor and founder of Windmeyers Vision. Dana had the idea to start a sunglasses business because she enjoys wearing sunglasses to remember fun days spent in the sun with her loved ones. Sunglasses are a stylish and expressive accessory that may complete an ensemble. It could be difficult to enjoy a wonderful day outside or while driving if you don't have the ideal pair of sunglasses. </p>
<h3>Creator of Windmeyers Vision</h3>

Some background about her is that she is pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer management information systems (CMIS) as a junior at Peru State College.

Summer is her favorite season since she enjoys boating, swimming, and riding ATVs.
